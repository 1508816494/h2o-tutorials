# Introductory H2O Machine Learning Tutorial
# Prepared for H2O Open Chicago 2016: http://open.h2o.ai/chicago.html


# First step is to download & install the h2o R library
# The latest version is always here: http://www.h2o.ai/download/h2o/r

# Load the H2O library and start up the H2O cluter locally on your machine
library(h2o)
h2o.init(nthreads = -1, #Number of threads -1 means use all cores on your machine
         max_mem_size = "8G")  #max mem size is the maximum memory to allocate to H2O



# Next we will import a cleaned up version of the Lending Club "Bad Loans" dataset
# The purpose here is to predict whether a loan will be bad (not repaid to the lender)
# The response column, bad_loan, is 1 if the loan was bad, and 0 otherwise

# Import the data
loan_csv <- "/Users/me/h2oai/code/demos/lending_club/loan.csv"  # modify this for your machine
# Alternatively, you can import the data directly from a URL
#loan_csv <- "https://s3.amazonaws.com/h2o-datasets/loan.csv"
data <- h2o.importFile(loan_csv)  # 163,994 rows x 15 columns
dim(data)
# [1] 163994     15

# Since we want to train a binary classification model, 
# we must ensure that the response is coded as a factor
# If the response is 0/1, H2O will assume it's numeric,
# which means that H2O will train a regression model instead
data$bad_loan <- as.factor(data$bad_loan)  #encode the binary repsonse as a factor
h2o.levels(data$bad_loan)  #optoional: after encoding, this shows the two factor levels, '0' and '1'
# [1] "0" "1"

# Partition the data into training, validation and test sets
splits <- h2o.splitFrame(data = data, 
                         ratios = c(0.7, 0.15),  #partition data into 70%, 15%, 15% chunks
                         seed = 1)  #setting a seed will guarantee reproducibility
train <- splits[[1]]
valid <- splits[[2]]
test <- splits[[3]]

# Take a look at the size of each partition
# Notice that h2o.splitFrame uses approximate splitting not exact splitting (for efficiency)
# so these are not exactly 70%, 15% and 15% of the total rows
nrow(train)  # 114914
nrow(valid) # 24499
nrow(test)  # 24581

# Identify response and predictor variables
y <- "bad_loan"
x <- setdiff(names(data), c(y, "int_rate"))  #remove the interest rate column because it's correlated with the outcome
print(x)
# [1] "loan_amnt"             "term"                 
# [3] "emp_length"            "home_ownership"       
# [5] "annual_inc"            "verification_status"  
# [7] "purpose"               "addr_state"           
# [9] "dti"                   "delinq_2yrs"

# Now that we have prepared the data, we can train some models
# We will start by training a single model from each of the H2O supervised algos:
# 1. Generalized Linear Model (GLM)
# 2. Random Forest (RF)
# 3. Gradient Boosting Machine (RF)
# 4. Deep Learning (DL)
# 5. Naive Bayes (NB)


# 1. Let's start with a basic binomial Generalized Linear Model
# By default, h2o.glm uses a regularized, elastic net model
glm_fit1 <- h2o.glm(x = x, 
                    y = y, 
                    training_frame = train,
                    model_id = "glm_fit1",
                    family = "binomial")  #similar to R's glm, h2o.glm has the family argument

# Next we will do some automatic tuning by passing in a validation frame and setting 
# `lambda_search = True`.  Since we are training a GLM with regularization, we should 
# try to find the right amount of regularization (to avoid overfitting).  The model 
# parameter, `lambda`, controls the amount of regularization in a GLM model and we can 
# find the optimal value for `lambda` automatically by setting `lambda_search = TRUE` 
# and passing in a validation frame (which is used to evaluate model performance using a 
# particular value of lambda).
glm_fit2 <- h2o.glm(x = x, 
                    y = y, 
                    training_frame = train,
                    model_id = "glm_fit2",
                    validation_frame = valid,
                    family = "binomial",
                    lambda_search = TRUE)

# Let's compare the performance of the two GLMs
glm_perf1 <- h2o.performance(model = glm_fit1,
                             newdata = test)
glm_perf2 <- h2o.performance(model = glm_fit2,
                             newdata = test)

# Print model performance
glm_perf1
glm_perf2

# Instead of printing the entire model performance metrics object, 
# it is probably easier to print just the metric that you are interested in comparing.
# Retreive test set AUC
h2o.auc(glm_perf1)  #0.673463297871
h2o.auc(glm_perf2)  #0.673426207356



# Compare test set AUC to validation set AUC
glm_fit2@model$validation_metrics  #0.6734262073556496
h2o.auc(glm_fit2, valid = TRUE)  #you can also use h2o.auc directly on a model to retreive AUC

# This shows that the AUC evaluated on the validation set (0.673) is slightly higher 
# than the AUC evaluated on the held-out test set (0.671).





# 2. Random Forest
# H2O's Random Forest (RF) is implements a distributed version of the standard 
# Random Forest algorithm and variable importance measures.
# First we will train a basic Random Forest model with default parameters. 
# Random Forest will infer the response distribution from the response encoding. 
# A seed is required for reproducibility.
rf_fit1 <- h2o.randomForest(x = x,
                            y = y,
                            training_frame = train,
                            model_id = "rf_fit1",
                            seed = 1)

# Next we will increase the number of trees used in the forest by setting `ntrees = 100`.  
# The default number of trees in an H2O Random Forest is 50, so this RF will be twice as 
# big as the default.  Usually increasing the number of trees in an RF will increase 
# performance as well.  Unlike Gradient Boosting Machines (GBMs), Random Forests are fairly 
# resistant (although not free from) overfitting by increasing the number of trees.  
# See the GBM example below for additional guidance on preventing overfitting using H2O's 
# early stopping functionality.
rf_fit2 <- h2o.randomForest(x = x,
                            y = y,
                            training_frame = train,
                            model_id = "rf_fit2",
                            #validation_frame = valid,  #only used if stopping_rounds > 0
                            ntrees = 100,
                            seed = 1)

# Let's compare the performance of the two RFs
rf_perf1 <- h2o.performance(model = rf_fit1,
                            newdata = test)
rf_perf2 <- h2o.performance(model = rf_fit2,
                            newdata = test)

# Print model performance
rf_perf1
rf_perf2

# Retreive test set AUC
h2o.auc(rf_perf1)  # 0.6650349613
h2o.auc(rf_perf2)  # 0.671842491069


# Cross-validate performance
# Rather than using held-out test set to evaluate model performance, a user may wish 
# to estimate model performance using cross-validation. Using the RF algorithm 
# (with default model parameters) as an example, we demonstrate how to perform k-fold 
# cross-validation using H2O. No custom code or loops are required, you simply specify 
# the number of desired folds in the nfolds argument.
# Since we are not going to use a test set here, we can use the original (full) dataset, 
# which we called data rather than the subsampled train dataset. Note that this will 
# take approximately k (nfolds) times longer than training a single RF model, since it 
# will train k models in the cross-validation process (trained on n(k-1)/k rows), in 
# addition to the final model trained on the full training_frame dataset with n rows.

rf_fit3 <- h2o.randomForest(x = x,
                            y = y,
                            training_frame = train,
